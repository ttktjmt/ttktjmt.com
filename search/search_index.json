Knowing that some people advanced from A1 to C1 within six months at language school made me question the gap between their progress and mine.</p> <p>Believing that there were many other people who might share my frustrations, I decided to investigate scientific research on language learning.

My strong motivation to learn English from middle school led me to various activities - watching English gaming videos on YouTube, participating in exchange programs in the US, and practicing with international students in Japan. I thought each method contributed to my English skills, but I couldn't pinpoint which method was most effective.</p> <p>Krashen\u2019s theory clarified my experience: I had been continuously receiving comprehensible input over a long period while enjoying the process.</p>"},{"location":"blog/discovering-the-best-way-to-acquire-a-new-language/#changing-my-strategy","title":"Changing My Strategy","text":"<p>Inspired by this realization, I significantly changed my approach to learning German. I shifted from \"studying\" to genuinely \"acquiring\" the language through enjoyable and effective methods. Specifically, I uninstalled Duolingo and Busuu and focused on the following activities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Watching Studio Ghibli movies in German</p> <p>Re-watching these films helped me get extended periods of comprehensible input. Being familiar with the storylines made it easier to infer the meanings of unknown words, which greatly expanded my vocabulary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Watching short videos on TikTok in German</p> <p>This method is great for those who struggle with motivation. Short videos allow you to experience how native speakers communicate and learn about their culture. TikTok's algorithm also helps by showing content that matches your interests, turning the addictive nature of short videos into a learning advantage. Setting the app to German content is particularly effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Listening to German podcasts</p> <p>Once you reach a certain level of comprehension, podcasts become a powerful source of input. Unlike other methods, you cannot turn on subtitles, so some understanding is necessary. Finding podcasts on topics you genuinely enjoy allows you to make use of downtime, like doing chores or commuting. My recommendation is to listen to content that interests you rather than language learning podcasts.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/discovering-the-best-way-to-acquire-a-new-language/#reflections","title":"Reflections","text":"<p>Implementing these methods and significantly increasing the time spent on them led to noticeable improvements in my German, especially in comprehension and speaking skills.
